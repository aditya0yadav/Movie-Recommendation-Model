# Movie-Recommendation-Model
This repository contains a movie recommendation system developed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. The model aims to suggest movies to users based on their viewing history and preferences. This project utilizes collaborative filtering techniques, making use of user ratings to predict and recommend new movie titles that users are likely to enjoy.

Features
Collaborative Filtering: Utilizes both user-based and item-based filtering to recommend movies.
Data Preprocessing: Implements robust preprocessing to handle missing data and scale ratings.
Model Evaluation: Includes precision and recall metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the recommendations.
Interactive Interface: Jupyter Notebook allows for interactive exploration of different user preferences and model parameters

Requirements
To run this notebook, you will need the following libraries:

    
    pandas
    numpy
    scikit-learn
    scipy
    matplotlib
